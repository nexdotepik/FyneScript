# FyneScript (Pre-Alpha)

**FyneScript** is a scripting language in its earliest stage of development. My goal is to create a modern language for text processing, automation, concurrency, and polyglot workflows.  

## Prototype
The project is currently being prototyped in Python. Currently in this stage, nothing is stable or ready for practical usage. 

## Contributing
Contributions are not open currently. Once FyneScript reaches a beta release, the project will begin accepting code and feature contributions.  

## Installation / Usage
FyneScript is not yet available for installation or practical use. Instructions will be provided once the language reaches beta stage. 

## Status
- Extremely early development  
- Not usable for scripting yet  
- Focused on testing core concepts before moving toward a standalone implementation

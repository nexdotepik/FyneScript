# FyneScript (Pre-Alpha) 
---

FyneScript is a **modern scripting language in development**, designed for **text processing, automation, concurrency, and polyglot workflows**.  
This repository contains the **early prototype**, with the goal of building a powerful, expressive, and readable scripting language.

## 🌟 Future Features (Planned)

- **Powerful Text Handling & Regex**  
  Native regex and string manipulation as first-class citizens for concise, one-liner operations.

- **Shell & System Scripting**  
  Full OS integration: run commands, manage files, access environment variables, with structured, type-safe pipelines.

- **Built-in Concurrency**  
  Lightweight threads, async, and parallel loops to make pipelines and tasks effortless.

- **Polyglot Glue**  
  Seamless integration with Python, Rust, C, Node, and more—coordinate multiple languages from the same script.

- **One-Liner & Quick Scripts**  
  Expressive, short commands for automation and processing without cryptic syntax.

- **Readable, Modern Syntax**  
  Minimal, consistent syntax prioritizing clarity and maintainability.

- **Human-Friendly Errors**  
  Clear, contextual error messages to reduce debugging time.

- **Cross-Platform & Portable**  
  Scripts that work on Linux, macOS, and Windows without platform-specific quirks.
